# seedQuest

  Key recovery is a widespread problem in the blockchain space, since human memory has difficulty remembering long strings of numbers, and having backups of keys(physical or digital) can create security vulnerabilities. This problem can be mitigated by creating a simple game which can be used as a method for recovering private keys. This game will have an explorable world with multiple “sites” or buildings/houses/caves where the player can find action spots. At each action spot, the player will have a choice of different actions to take. A journey through this world to take four actions at four different sites will be reasonable for a human to remember, and provide enough shards of entropy to be combined into a 128-bit string used for a key.
  The world built for seed quest would include 256 map areas, with 4 sites (buildings) in each area, with 8 action spots in each site (building), with 8 possible actions at each site. The number of sites per area and the number of action spots per site could be variable as long as there are a total of 32 action spots per map area. 256 areas = 2^8 bits of entropy, 32 action spots per area = 2^5 bits of entropy, 8 actions per spot = 2^3 bits of entropy. 
	With a visual world to explore, the mnemonic load of remembering a seed is significantly reduced. As long as someone can remember four actions at four locations, the seed can be recovered at any time by playing the game.
